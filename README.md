The data used was obtained from [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip ) but was sourced from [http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones ](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones )


### summary of the task: ###

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The Code for assignment is in file 'run_analysis.R'



The file CodeBook.md contain:

1. information about various decisions in the steps taken during the code/analysis and 
2. a description of the data in the two data files submitted

The submitted 'Tidy Data' is in files:

1. alldata.csv (covering steps 1,2,3,4 above)
2. alldata.MeanMeans.csv (for step 5)
